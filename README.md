# Python_Image_Classification

This notebook was created for [this](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dogs-vs-cats-redux-kernels-edition/overview) expired Kaggle competition which aimed to classify cat and dog images.


In order to classify the images, I built two different models. 

* Typical CNN model: 
    * I built a typical model with Convolution layers and two hidden layer. This did not produce high accuracies, so I decided to build a pre-trained model instead.
* Xception model:
    * This produced better accuracies, so I used this model as my final submission to the Kaggle competition

The final submission score was 0.04806.
